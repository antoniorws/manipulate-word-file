# Simple Project to Manipulate a Word File With Java


## Code Description
The code creates a new document that is based on the oldFile.docx file, which it calls newDocument.
It loops through all of the paragraphs in this document to update their names with "newName" and "oldName".
Then it loops through all of the runs in each paragraph to update them as well, but only if they are not empty (meaning there is text in them).
Finally, it updates all of the tables in this document using similar logic.
The code demonstrates how to update text in a document.

## How to use
 - Clone this project
 - Create a Word file called oldFile.docx in the root directory
 - Change the variables Strings (oldName and newName) for what you want
